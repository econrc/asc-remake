The Trade and Development Programme focuses on the causes and consequences of globalization on economic development, inequality, and social welfare. The aim of the Programme is to generate high-quality academic studies and policy reports on international trade and global capital flows, and their impact on labour markets, industrial structures, and economic development. It also emphasizes the rise of China as the world’s factory, and Hong Kong’s status as Asia’s trade centre, as well as policies and issues related to trade and economic growth.
