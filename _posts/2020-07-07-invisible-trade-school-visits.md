On May 15 and 20, Prof. Travis NG led our student helpers to implement our game "Invisible Trade" for the students from Pentecostal Lam Hon Kwong School and Po Leung Kuk Yao Ling Sun College respectively. It was a valuable experience for both of our students and the secondary school students to learn from. We would like to take this opportunity to appreciate the teaching staff at these two schools for their assistance and organisation. We are glad to see the participants have gained more knowledge about trade and Hong Kong trading situation from the game.
