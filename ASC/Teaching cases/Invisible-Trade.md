# Introduction

Invisible Trade is one of the teaching cases in the human capital theme. It is dedicated to describe the current trade composition of Hong Kong and its difference from the past. We used two games to explain the common misconception of the recent Hong Kong trading evaluation, the main intuition is the fundamental economics concept: price, quantity and total value. The teaching case is, firstly, internal tested and fine-tuned in The Chinese University of Hong Kong and further implemented in two Hong Kong local public secondary school for assessment. The feedback of the teaching plan and material are generally positive, the economics concept and the class management are well delivered. We encourage external party to use those teaching material for the education purposes.

# Description

Invisible Trade is designed by a team of CUHK students. They researched the recent Hong Kong trading figures from the official data of Census and Statistic department and discovered that some of the related media coverage may not fully evaluate the current trading figures. Instead of the traditional trade method which evaluation is subject to the number of cargo, offshore trade, which does not necessarily involve with physical shipment and often be neglected in the media coverage, is one of the the most popular trade method. As a result there is a misconception among public that the trading situation of Hong Kong has been worsen. They took this as an opportunity and further developed it as a topic for the teaching material. In the teaching case, student are grouped and will learn tradition trade and offshore trade, two different major trading patterns of Hong Kong respectively in the past and current, from the presentation and playing the two games. Game 1 is the baseline. It imitates the traditional situation of a company decision maker to decide which contract to take with respect to the benefit. The group has the highest profit will be the winner.

# Learning Outcome

The games deliver the four fundamental economics concept: **price, quantity, revenue and profit.**

- Students should soon realize the quantity or price does not independently reflect the revenue/value of the trade. Students are expected to maximize the revenue in Game 1 by calculating the the product of quantity and price.
- In Game 2, students are provided with the option between traditional trade and offshore trade, which varies the penalty, therefore, the cost. Students are expected to adopt the cost in the calculation and understand the concept that profit does not equal revenue.
- From the game result, students should observe the number of cargo reduced significant when the offshore trade option is available. The importance of offshore trade should be delivered and student should have a better understanding of current Hong Kong trading pattern after the section.

# Game Flow

- Essentially, students are presented with a deck of _trade card_ which represents the contracts/opportunities that the business encounters
- Cards are differentiated by its respective quantity and price, the deal revenue/reward is the product of quantity and price.

## Game 1

### Flow

- Groups will nominate a `picker' to select the deal in interested. Deals' reward/revenue is granted with the respective task completion.
- In order to elicit the essence of traditional trading pattern, a box (cargo) is folded by group with the deal completion.
  Notably, in Game 1, there is no cost involvement other than the time consumed for completing the task.

### Rules

1. Each group should send only ONE representative to pick or submit the trade cards as well as the completed mission.
2. Once the trade card is picked, return of the trade card is prohibited unless the game ends or completion of the deal.
3. Only submission of both the completed “cargo” and the task is regarded as completion of the deal.
4. The group with the highest total value generated from completing the deals will be the winner.

## Game 2

### Flow

- Students are provided with an option to switch the deal trading method between traditional trade or offshore trade, cargo is not required when latter is chosen.
- Time constraint varies among deals and trading methods there is overtime penalty if the team selected an inappropriate trade method.
- Both Games involve randomness in picking the trade card which balances the ability differences between groups. Overall, the teaching section will be completed with in an hour, the regular time length of a conventional class in local school. In the last two Implementation, the section and games executed orderly and finished within 30 mins and remained 15-20 mins for the follow up presentation.

### Rules

1. Each group should send only ONE representative to pick or submit the trade cards as well as the completed mission.
2. Once the trade card is picked, return of the trade card is prohibited unless the game ends or completion of the deal.
3. For groups that have chosen offshore trade as the method of trade, submission of the completed task is regarded as completion of the deal. For groups that have chosen traditional trade, only submission both the completed “cargo” and the task is regarded as completion of the deal.
4. There will be penalty once the time constraint is failed to meet by the trading method chosen. The penalty is based on the number of days of delay and the total value of the respective groups will be deducted.
5. The group with the highest total value generated from completing the deals will be the winner.

# Implementation

With the generous help of two local secondary schools, the teaching case was successfully implemented in class. The responsible students of the teaching case from CUHK went to Pantecostal Lam Hon Kwong School and Po Leung Kuk Yao Ling Sun College to present the teaching case to senior secondary students who study economics. We would like to once again express our gratitude to the schools for collaborating the success of the demonstrations.

## Pentecostal Lam Hon Kwong School

The demonstration was held on 20 May 2019, the teaching case was presented to 28 form 4 students taking economics as their electives. Students paid attention and show interest in the presentation and the games. Rewards were given to the winning group and other participants.

## Po Leung Kuk Yao Ling Sun College

The demonstration was held on 15 June 2019, the teaching case was presented to 29 form 4 students taking economics as their electives. Students actively participated during the game. Our project director, Professor Travis Ng had presented rewards to the winners.

# Conclusion

Students were more familiar with the concepts of visible traditional trade but showed a lack of understanding in the invisible offshore trade. Media coverage may be one of the reasons for such misunderstanding. It is important to teach not only students studying economics, but all students to provide a more completed view towards the trading and logistics industry, which is the Four Key Industry in Hong Kong. Offshore trade is becoming more significant in Hong Kong, certainly introducing invisible trade is important. The teaching case succeeds in illustrating the importance of invisible offshore trade, enabling students to widen their horizon in reviewing Hong Kong’s trading figures.

# Feedback

It is reported that students have good understanding on the traditional trade, as well as the logistic industry. More focus can be put into the part of knowledge transfer, in elaborating more about the unfamiliar offshore trade to secondary students to confirm the information was well received by the students.
