# Evaluation
The ISS was a successful event. Participants found it eye-opening and they treasured the opportunities to learn about the latest development in technology startups in both Hong Kong and Shenzhen, China and to understand the successful cases of tech start-ups from HK, Taiwan, and Thailand. The cultural exchange among participants from various places was also invaluable.

## Note for further development
- Preparation needs to start as early as possible to work out schedule for firm visits and arrange accommodation
- Participants also need more time for preparation and conducting their studies;
- Due to financial constraints, it may not be easy for SE Asian teams to join. Subsidy is very important to attract those teams.
